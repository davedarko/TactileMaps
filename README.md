# TactileMaps
The process to generate the maps is currently as followed: there are certain layers in the SVG that get imported and extruded in the OpenSCAD file. For certain areas there are 3D objects needed, that can't be "extruded", so they were manually placed.
There is a braille generator script in the files, that turns "Strings" into squished spheres following a standard.


## Filament considerations
Our first two maps were printed in a darker eggplant colored PLA and a yellow one. The summer sun was not nice to the prints, so we decided for 2025 that we would print the new maps with a bright / white PETG filament. 
3Djake's EasyPETG turned out to print very clean on the PrusaXL of xHain, our Berlin hackspace.  

## Nation Of Gondwana 2025
For the second year we have now created a 3D map of the camp festival grounds with legend so people can get a first idea of the layout.
Here we have also printed the map with different colored filament, to have a contrast version.
